Can I request the data from an incomplete 15 minutes?

Controls: earlier, later, temp/humidity

Program steps:

Set the zoom and location
Load map
Load controls in a disabled state
Calculate most-recent 5 minute view time
Call the main function

Main function:
Disable controls
Request data to cover at least the half hour prior to the view time
Throw away not-needed data (keep station ID, location, temp, humidity)
Throw away entries with no temp and humidity data
Cache the data from the requests
Sort the data from youngest to oldest
Iterate through the data and display a marker for each weather station, up to 30 mins old, indicating age with opacity. Keep track of which stations are already displayed to avoid duplication
Enable controls

When time changes call the main function again
